Run `tox -e update-zuul-config` to update the zuul config for
submodules according to the contents of .gitmodules.

This assumes that all submodules and superprojects share the same
branch (but this is supported for multiple branches).  For example, if
the superproject has branches "main" and "dev", then it is expected
that the .gitmodules file references the "main" branch (or the current
branch, ".") for every submodule included.  And the "dev" branch of
the superproject references only "dev" branches of submodules.

If this assumption does not hold, a slightly more complex/verbose
configuration is needed.

This assumes a change to Zuul to permit this superproject module to
configure jobs on subprojects.  An example of the proposed syntax for
the corresponding tenant configuration file is in the zuul-config
repo.
